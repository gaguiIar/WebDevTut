      <p>Are you looking to break into tech but don't have extensive programming experience? My name is Gerardo, and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science & Business Administration at the University of Southern California. I believe that with enough dedication, anyone can become a successful developer, so I built this website with that in mind. Introduction to Web Development is a resource aimed to help any beginner looking to branch into tech by breaking down web fundamentals such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript. If you're interested in learning more about web development, I applaud and encourage you to keep reading on. To start, you will want some type of IDE or Integrated Development Environment. I recommend Atom, but Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code are also very popular HTML text editors. You can't go wrong with either, so I recommend you read a bit about all options and pick one you can quickly become familiar with. Don't be afraid to get started; You can use the navigation bar below this paragraph or the directional arrows to navigate the sections of this website.

        <p>Much of this website is a condensed version of what I learned throughout my Web Publishing course, cross-examined with Jon Duckett's "HTML & CSS" to figure out how to explain these topics in the simplest way possible. If you would like a vastly more in-depth explanation of all the topics discussed and then some, I can highly recommend you check out <em><a href="https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf" target="_blank">Duckett's book</a></em> for all of your needs. <br><br>Furthermore, <em><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp.org</a></em> is an excellent resource(and one I've used) for aspiring programmers to learn new skills through lessons and examples; they offer courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you would like to check them out!</p>

          <h3>Closing Remarks:</h3>
          <p> This website started as a passion project, and with a combined <em>xxxx</em> lines of HTML, JavaScript & CSS, <em>xx</em> days in start-to-finish planning, and <em>xx</em> GitHub commits evolved to be one of my most extensive programming endeavors to date!<br><br>Knowing how daunting the world of tech can be, condensing some of what I've learned the past few months all into one place was a great joy, and with that, I hope you've found this guide particularly serviceable in your web dev journey. As you start to get your footing, I implore you to reference my<br> <em><a href="comingSoon.html" target="_blank">HTML & CSS cheatsheet</a></em> as a last resource available at your disposal. If you would like to learn more about the author of this website(aka me), I'm hosted permanently at <em><a href="http://gerardoaguilar.com/" target="_blank">gerardoaguilar.com</a></em> and I'd love to borrow your eyes for a few moments to show you what I've been working on!<br><br>Best of luck,<br><br></p>
