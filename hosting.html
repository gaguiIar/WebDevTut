      <h1>Introduction to Web Development</h1>
      <h2>By Gerardo Aguilar</h2>

      <p>Are you looking to break into tech but don't have extensive programming experience? My name is Gerardo, and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science & Business Administration at the University of Southern California. I believe that with
        enough dedication, anyone can become a successful developer, so I built this website with that in mind. Introduction to Web Development is a resource aimed to help any beginner looking to branch into tech by breaking down web fundamentals
        such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript. If you're interested in learning more about web development, I applaud and encourage you to keep reading on. To start, you will want some type of IDE or Integrated Development Environment. I recommend Atom, but
        Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code are also very popular HTML text editors. You can't go wrong with either, so I recommend you read a bit about all options and pick one you can quickly become familiar with. Don't be afraid to get started; You
        can use the navigation bar below this paragraph or the directional arrows to navigate the sections of this website.

          <p>GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control. You can sign up for a <em><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub account here.</a></em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There are two ways to <em>push</em> your code into GitHub from your workstation, the foremost being through a <em>command-line</em>, but the more straightforward way being through <em>GitHub Desktop.</em> I recommend you pick the ladder
            as it provides a simpler interface, but you can see setup instructions and documentation by clicking either link.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When youâ€™ve set up your preferred method of pushing code, you will want to find out how to <em>make a new repository</em> and extract the contents of the code you want to push to this repository. Once your code is in the same folder of
            the repository, you can <em>commit to main</em> and then <em>"push"</em> it to GitHub, which will add your code to your online GitHub Repository.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The benefits of pushing your code to your GitHub Repository include being able to keep track of versions of your project, commits, and if you make your repo public contributing to the Git Community as well as free hosting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Once your code has been committed, you should find your repo on GitHub and <em>find the settings option under the repository name.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you scroll down to GitHub Pages, you will find a <em>Source option</em> change this to <em>main</em> and <em>save</em>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Github should now display a URL inside the GitHub pages section, where your project will live. <em> As long as your repository is public, you will be able to share your website through this link for free.</em> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you would like to use a custom domain, you can follow <em><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site" target="_blank">this guide here.</a></em></p>
