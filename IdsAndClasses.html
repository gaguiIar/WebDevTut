      <p>Are you looking to break into tech but don't have extensive programming experience? My name is Gerardo, and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science & Business Administration at the University of Southern California. I believe that with
        enough dedication, anyone can become a successful developer, so I built this website with that in mind. Introduction to Web Development is a resource aimed to help any beginner looking to branch into tech by breaking down web fundamentals
        such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript. If you're interested in learning more about web development, I applaud and encourage you to keep reading on. To start, you will want some type of IDE or Integrated Development Environment. I recommend Atom, but
        Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code are also very popular HTML text editors. You can't go wrong with either, so I recommend you read a bit about all options and pick one you can quickly become familiar with. Don't be afraid to get started; You
        can use the navigation bar below this paragraph or the directional arrows to navigate the sections of this website.

          </li>
          <p>There are three types of CSS–– <em>External, Internal and inline.</em> Now a days inline css is not standard and should not be used. IInternal css  on the other hand goes in the head of your html document under opening and closing <em>&lt;style&gt;</em> tags Internal css only effects that html page. As the name implies external CSS is on an external file.css document. The css in your css document will be applied to any html file that has that css file linked in the heading, as you recall we can link an external css in an html document by using a link tag. As I mentioned inline css is no longer standard and should not be used, so when should you use external over internal CSS?  Well when you are building multi-length web-pagews and you want to have styling that is applied to them all this should be put in an external master css file as to avoid repeating code. If you want specific styling that will only be applied to one document add it internally in the head tag in between
            <em>style</em> tags.
